Paper writting challenge

Imagine you drafted an excellent paragraph for a paper you are writing, but later ruin it. How would you retrieve the excellent version of your conclusion? Is it even possible?
  
  This could be possible rarely if you have miltiple copies of that document
  
  Imagine you have 5 co-authors. How would you manage the changes and comments they make to your paper? If you use LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word, what happens if you accept changes made using the Track Changes option? Do you have a history of those changes
  
  You can use different platforms and only allow people who you have a document shared with to add comments. The tractchanges will highlight the changes but i believe once you accept a change the old version will be lost. There is no history of those changes.
